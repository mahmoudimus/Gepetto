"""Gepetto's view of whichever Qt binding this IDA embeds.

Qt is imported only when `idaapi.is_idaq()` says IDA is the GUI, because
`import PySide6` succeeding proves nothing on its own -- headless IDA, idalib
and a test runner can all have the wheel on the path with no QApplication
behind it, and a widget built there is a crash rather than a dialog.

What is here is the part that is about IDA rather than about Qt: finding a
window to parent a dialog to, and reading an enum whose scoping changed
between Qt5 and Qt6.
